In the past there was no way for patients, academics or clinicians around Ireland to record their medical details electronically which created numerous problems.<\/p>\n<h4>The Solution<\/h4>\n<p>The PISCES Project is about using technologies to promote a model of precision, proactive and personalised healthcare for the more than 40,000 people with epilepsy across Ireland. The solution developed is an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) and Patient Portal App focused exclusively on the needs of epilepsy patients. The patient portal is a mobile-first, cloud-based solution. No matter where care is delivered, information can be collected, added to the care record and accessed by the care team regardless of geographic location or care setting. The project also involves the development of a BI solution which enables clinicians to securely use aggregated patient data to analyse and gather insights for the wider patient community to inform future care and population health.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think it definitely is a step of independence for a lot of people that don\u2019t have that at all. They feel like they are kind of controlling in some way an illness that you can\u2019t control at all.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Clinicians now have a streamlined view of patient information through the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) \u2013 a single source of truth where all patient medical information can be recorded and accessed from anywhere nationwide. As part of the EPR, genetic data can be easily interpreted, and documenting decisions and agreed actions has been simplified.<\/p>\n<p>Via: ErgoGroup.ie<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The \u2018Lighthouse Projects\u2019 are in the clinical disciplines of the chronic diseases Epilepsy, Haemophilia and Bipolar Disorder.
